#summary Advanced Bongos configuration (WIP)
#labels Featured

So, you've figured out what right click menus are, you can move and scale things like a champ, and you know how to get to the options window.  But, you're still a little lost on how to do a few advanced things.  


== Configuring things Faster (Slash Commands) ==

The slash command handler in Bongos is there to do two things:  Configure things fast, and Configure things precisely.  Need the bags to be faded to exactly 30.5%?  `/bob setalpha bags 0.305`  Need to hide bars 7 to 120?  `/bob hide 7-120`  Also need to hide the bags?  `/bob hide 7-120 bags` will do it.

All bar specific slash commands take a barList.  A bar list is an individual bar id (ex, bags), all for all bars, a range (1-120 for bars 1-120), or any combination of those separated by a space (ex, menu bags 1-10 for the menu and bag bars, as well as actionbars 1-10).  If you understand that syntax, you can configure things *very* quickly.

Now, for the commands:
