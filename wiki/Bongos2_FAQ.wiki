==FAQ==

*Will I be able to keep my profiles when upgrading from Bongos to Bongos2?*

Profiles are incompatible between Bongos and Bongos2 due to the alterations I've made to the profiles system in Bongos2.


*Will I lose my settings when updating from Bongos2 version X to Bongos2 version Y?*

As of 1.6.0, Bongos2's versioning system uses the format major.minor.bugfix (ex 1.6.2)
  * If there is a change in the major version (1.0.0 to 2.0.0), then you are probably going to lose your settings.  I'm going to make an attempt to convert settings whenever possible.
  * If there is a change in the minor version (1.5.0 to 1.6.0), then you need to completely restart Warcraft to properly update Bongos.  Settings will be preserved.
  * If there's a change in the bugfix version (1.6.1 to 1.6.2), then you'll be good to go with just a reload.  The version won't bump until you completely restart, though.


*My bindings don't work when I switch stances!*

You need to either convert your bindings from Bongos1/the default actionbar (/run BongosActionBar:ConvertBindings(true)) or bind your keys using KeyBound (/kb or /keybound).  

The reason this happens is because if you have not bound your keys, then you're actually pressing the old blizzard buttons, and not the bongos ones, which share the same action IDs when in your base state (not stealthed, caster formed, battle stance, etc), but do not change when you switch stances.
