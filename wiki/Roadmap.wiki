#summary Stuff I want to do
#labels Featured

Bagnon:
  * Modernize codebase

Bagnon_Forever:
  * Need to deal with links that include player levels (maybe)
  * Store token information
  * Crazy town: Implement guild bank support

Combuctor:
  * Switch to using bag sounds instead of merchant frame sounds
  * Implement better set API
  * Add in event-> tab event system (ex, show bank frame, normal tab when showing the bank, keyring when I click the keyring, trade bags...)
  * Add in a few configuration options

[Dominos]:
  * Revise wiki, add FAQ
  * Make Dominos have a saner layout for 1-120 bars
  * Add in a separate possess bar (optional addon)
  * If I implement a saner layout for variable numbers of bars, along with the separate possess bar option, then put in sliders for numbars/numbuttons.  These should have a confirmation, since they'll toast layouts.

  * Implement linked bar auto fading
  * Implement state based opacity
  * Crazy town: The ability to customize state headers (like Bartender4)

OmniCC:
  * Return of the shine option?

Sage:
  * Rewrite for 3.0
  * Incorporate new libraries (ace3, lsm3.0, etc)
  * Incorporate some sort of threat display
  * Implement a new buff display: should give priority to my buffs/debuffs
  * Use a template system of some sort to make it easier to create new jambers


SellFish:

Tipachu:
  * Add support for talents & spells, if possible
  * Fix compatibility issues if they're actually my fault
