KeyBound is an intuitive key binding interface originally developed for Bongos. Using KeyBound, keys are bound simply by hovering over a button and pressing a key.  KeyBound was based on the key binding system used by [http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6391-TrinityBars.html Trinity Bars].

Keybound was converted into a LibStub library by Toadkiller, and given the new name LibKeyBound-1.0.  The library now resides on [http://www.wowace.com/projects/libkeybound-1-0/ wowace] and is currently used by Bartender4 and Dominos.
