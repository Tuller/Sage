#summary Because lets face it, you want to give me money :P

Due to the significant time I invest in developing addons, and because I've been asked before, I have a paypal account setup for donations.  All money will be spent on the following:
  * _World of Warcraft_ subscription fees
  * Computer parts
  * Video games
  * Shiny things
  * Food
  * A trustworthy pony
  * Other

Note: That list does not include "implementing features you pay me to."

If you don't want to donate money to myself, please consider donating to your favorite addons site where I host my stuff.  Bandwidth is expensive, you know.
