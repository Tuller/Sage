#summary The Bongos2 Readme

= So what the heck is Bongos? =

Bongos is a main action bar replacement.  The main action bar, as you know, is that thing at the bottom of the screen that acts as your main interface for accessing your inventory, opening a few panels, making your pet do things, and of course using spells and ability.

What Bongos does is it takes that interface, splits it up into a series of customizable "bars" (a bar for your bags, one for your pet, an experience bar, etc), and adds a few more features, like more action buttons and a better bindings system.

Bongos has been designed for three audiences: Myself, my friends, and the majority.  The result has been an action bar addon that is relatively easy to use and quick to setup, but also one that does not offer every feature under the sun.


= Great, now how do I use it? =

There are four main things you should know about when using Bongos:  The minimap button, the main options menu, locking and unlocking bars, and per bar configuration.

== The Minimap Button ==

On your minimap, you'll find a button with a bongos icon.  This is your Bongos minimap button, an object which provides you quick access to two common functions: Toggling the main options menu and locking and unlocking bar positions.

You can toggle locking bar positions simply by left clicking the minimap button.  Right clicking will toggle the main options menu.

If you don't like the button, there's a checkbox to turn it off in the options menu.


== The Main Options Menu ==

The main options window is where you can configure *general* settings:  You'll find things like saving and loading profiles, hiding and showing hotkeys, locking and unlocking bar positions, a color picker for out of range coloring, etc.

There's two ways to get to it.  You can either use the slash command /bongos, or you can click the minimap button.


Slash Commands
   * All commands start with either /bongos, /bob, or /bgs
   *  <barList> can have a possible value of an actionbar number, menu, bags, pet. class, or all 
   * You can also specify a group or range of bars, the command /bo scale 1-3 class 1.2 will scale actionbars 1 2 3, and the class bar to 120% of their normal size.
